Requirements (or what I'm using):
- python 3.12 (older should be fine)
- scipy = 1.11.3
- numpy = 1.26.0
- pydub = 0.25.1
- matplotlib

I think that's it?
There are a bunch of random audio files from previous tests. I think the only useful one is `Bohemian Rhapsody.mp3`, which is the original sound file I used to test.
- `phase1.py` contains the code to create `dowmsampled_bohemian.wav`
